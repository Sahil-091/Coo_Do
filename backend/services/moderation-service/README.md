# moderation-service

Will own community moderation from Phase 12 onward (gated behind this being production-ready per Section 5.4). Empty router at Phase 0.

Independently runnable FastAPI service — has its own `requirements.txt`
and `Dockerfile` so it can be deployed on its own, per R&D doc Section 18
(service boundaries) and Section 21.

## Run locally
```
cd backend/services/moderation-service
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port <see docker-compose.yml>
```
